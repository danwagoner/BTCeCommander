# BTCeCommander
A GUI powershell script written with PowerShell Studio 2012 that makes trading on the btce exchange quick and easy. To make use of the script, create an API key in the btce / wex.nz interface and drop key and secret into btce.conf. Development on the script isn't likely to continue.
